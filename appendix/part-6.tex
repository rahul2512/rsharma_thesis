\chapter{Codes and data availability}\label[appendix]{app6}

The current version of the cgNA$+$ model is available (in python and MATLAB) at \hfill \linebreak \href{https://github.com/rahul2512/cgNA_plus}{https://github.com/rahul2512/cgNA\_plus}. This code is straightforward to use and requires a few python libraries to run the python code. 
The Python version has more functionalities; for instance, the code to obtain the sugar ring from cgNA$+$ coarse-grained configuration.

The codes used for training the cgNA$+$ model are available at \hfill \linebreak \href{https://github.com/rahul2512/cgNA_plus_training}{https://github.com/rahul2512/cgNA\_plus\_training}
and 
\href{https://github.com/rahul2512/cgNAplus_sugar_fitting}{https://github.com/rahul2512/cgNAplus\_sugar\_fitting}. 
Note that these codes require data to train the model, which is not provided on GitHub due to size limits. 
However, all the data can be obtained on request to \href{mailto://rs25.iitr@gmail.com}{rs25.iitr@gmail.com}. 


Finally, all the codes used for plotting the figures in this thesis can be accessed at \hfill \linebreak \href{https://github.com/rahul2512/rsharma_thesis}{https://github.com/rahul2512/rsharma\_thesis} along with the latex file of this thesis.
Note that some of the data must be requested to \href{mailto://rs25.iitr@gmail.com}{rs25.iitr@gmail.com} due to the size limits on GitHub.
